			<center><h3> Our Mission </h3></center>
				<P class="p"> RedRiot is committed to ensuring that all employees follow local laws and regulations, as well as a strict global code of conduct.
					It considers ethical management to be not only a tool for responding to the rapid changes in the global business environment, but also
					a vehicle for building trust with its various stakeholders, which include customers, shareholders, employees, business partners, and local
					communities. RedRiot continues to train its employees and run monitoring systems in order to become one of the most ethical companies in the
					world, all while practicing fair and transparent corporate management.

			<center><h3> Our approach </h3></center>
				<P class="p"> RedRiot's business philosophy is straightforward: devote its talent and technology to developing superior products and services that
					contribute to a better global society. To accomplish this, Samsung places a premium on its people and technologies.

			<center><h3> Our History  </h3></center>
				<P class="p"> Shevonne Dixon, Jamoy James, Teara Griffiths, Jude Burey, and Juvaugn Foster founded the RedRiot organization in 2022. The group of
					friends started the company while attending Excelsior Community College as a way to make quick cash, but Teara Griffiths and Jude Burey, who were
					studying business, saw that not only could the company be used for quick cash, but it could also be a very profitable venture that they could
					participate in after graduation.
